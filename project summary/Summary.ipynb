    "1. **Correlation Analysis**  \n",
    "   - Evaluated relationships between features and performance rating using correlation matrices to identify strong associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Machine Learning Model**  \n",
    "   - **Best Model:** `RandomForestClassifier`  \n",
    "   - **Accuracy:** **92.08.00%**  \n",
    "   - **Justification:** High performance, robustness to overfitting, and ability to handle both categorical and numerical data.  \n",
    "   - **Feature Importance:** Random Forest also provided clear insights into which features most influence performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Preprocessing**  \n",
    "   - **Label Encoding:** Applied to ordinal categorical features.  \n",
    "   - **One-Hot Encoding (OHE):** Used for nominal categorical variables to make them suitable for machine learning models.  \n",
    "   - **Outlier Handling:** Detected and treated using statistical techniques to ensure data quality.\n",
    "   - **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** was implemented to address class imbalance in the target variable.\n",
    "   - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** was explored for dimensionality reduction; however, it resulted in **lower accuracy**. Therefore, PCA was not used in the final model as performance was **better without it**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization Techniques**  \n",
    "   - Used **distribution plots**, **bar charts**, and **correlation heatmaps** to uncover trends, relationships, and data patterns visually.\n",
